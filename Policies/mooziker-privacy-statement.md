## Mooziker Privacy Statement

### What information Mooziker collects

"**User Personal Information**" is any information about one of our Users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify them or otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them. Information such as a username and password, an email address, a real name, an Internet protocol (IP) address, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.”

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information that does not identify a User or cannot otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them. We may use such aggregated, non-personally identifying information for research purposes and to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our Website and Service.

#### Information users provide directly to Mooziker

##### Registration information
We require some basic information at the time of account creation. When you create your own username and password, we ask you for a valid email address.

##### Payment information
If you sign on to a paid Account with us, we collect your full name, address, and credit card information. Please note, Mooziker does not process or store your credit card information, but our third-party payment processor does.

##### Profile information
You may choose to give us more information for your Account profile, such as your full name, an avatar which may include a photograph, your biography, your location, your company, and a URL to a third-party website. This information may include User Personal Information. Please note that your profile information may be visible to other Users of our Service.

#### Information Mooziker automatically collects from your use of the Service

##### Transactional information
If you have a paid Account with us, we automatically collect certain information about your transactions on the Service, such as the date, time, and amount charged.

##### Usage information
If you're accessing our Service or Website, we automatically collect the same basic information that most services collect, subject, where necessary, to your consent. This includes information about how you use the Service, such as the pages you view, the referring site, your IP address and session information, and the date and time of each request. This is information we collect from every visitor to the Website, whether they have an Account or not. This information may include User Personal information.

##### Cookies and similar technologies information
As further described below, and subject, where applicable, to your consent, we automatically collect information from cookies and similar technologies (such as cookie ID and settings) to keep you logged in, to remember your preferences, and to identify you and your device.

##### Device information
We may collect certain information about your device, such as its IP address, browser or client application information, language preference, operating system and application version, device type and ID, and device model and manufacturer. This information may include User Personal information.

#### Information we collect from third parties

Mooziker may collect User Personal Information from third parties. For example, this may happen if you sign up for training or to receive information about Mooziker from one of our vendors, partners, or affiliates. Mooziker does not purchase User Personal Information from third-party data brokers.

### What information Mooziker does not collect

We do not intentionally collect “**[Sensitive Personal Information](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/)**”, such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. If you choose to store any Sensitive Personal Information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.

If you are a child under the age of 13, you may not have an Account on Mooziker. Mooziker does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a User who is under the age of 13, we will have to close your Account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please see our [Terms of Service](/Policies/mooziker-terms-of-service) for information about Account termination. Different countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not have an Account on Mooziker.

We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is **stored in your repositories** or other free-form content inputs. Any personal information within a user's repository is the responsibility of the repository owner.

- We use User Personal Information and other data to make recommendations for you, such as to suggest projects you may want to follow or contribute to. We learn from your public behavior on Mooziker—such as the projects you star—to determine your coding interests, and we recommend similar projects. These recommendations are automated decisions, but they have no legal impact on your rights.
- We may use User Personal Information to invite you to take part in surveys, beta programs, or other research projects, subject, where necessary, to your consent .

#### Our legal bases for processing information

To the extent that our processing of your User Personal Information is subject to certain international laws (including, but not limited to, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), Mooziker is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. Mooziker processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:

- Contract Performance:
  * When you create a Mooziker Account, you provide your [Registration Information](#registration-information). We require this information for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process that information on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your username and email address on other legal bases, as described below.
  * If you have a paid Account with us, we collect and process additional [Payment Information](#payment-information) on the basis of performing that contract.
  * When you buy or sell an application listed on our Marketplace or, when you send or receive funds through the Mooziker Sponsors Program, we process [Payment Information](#payment-information) and additional elements in order to perform the contract that applies to those services.
- Consent:
  * We rely on your consent to use your User Personal Information under the following circumstances: when you fill out the information in your [user account](https://mooziker.com/account); when you decide to participate in a Mooziker training, research project, beta program, or survey; and for marketing purposes, where applicable. All of this User Personal Information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time. While you are not able to delete your email address entirely, you can make it private. You may withdraw your consent at any time.
- Legitimate Interests:
  * Generally, the remainder of the processing of User Personal Information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interest, for example, for legal compliance purposes, security purposes, or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of Mooziker’s systems, Website, and Service.
- If you would like to request deletion of data we process on the basis of consent or if you object to our processing of personal information, please contact privacy@mooziker.com with the subject line "Data deletion request".

### How we share the information we collect

We may share your User Personal Information with third parties under one of the following circumstances:

#### With your consent
We share your User Personal Information, if you consent, after letting you know what information will be shared, with whom, and why. For example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application Developer to provide you with services. Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on Mooziker to share your User Personal Information. For example, if you join an Organization, you indicate your willingness to provide the owner of the Organization with the ability to view your activity in the Organization’s access log.

#### With service providers
We share User Personal Information with a limited number of service providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements or making similar commitments. Our service providers perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, security, and other similar services. Our service providers may process data outside of New Zealand, the United States, or the European Union. If you would like to know who our service providers are, please see our page on [Subprocessors](/Policies/mooziker-subprocessors-and-cookies).

#### For security purposes
If you are a member of an Organization, Mooziker may share your username, [Usage Information](#usage-information), and [Device Information](#device-information) associated with that Organization with an owner and/or administrator of the Organization, to the extent that such information is provided only to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.

#### For legal disclosure
Mooziker strives for transparency in complying with legal process and legal obligations. Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, or in rare, exigent circumstances, we make a reasonable effort to notify users of any legally compelled or required disclosure of their information. Mooziker may disclose User Personal Information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

#### Change in control or sale
We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our Website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we made in our Privacy Statement or Terms of Service.

#### Aggregate, non-personally identifying information
We may share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Mooziker, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events.

We **do not** sell your User Personal Information for monetary or other consideration.

Please note: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) requires businesses to state in their privacy policy whether or not they disclose personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. While CCPA only covers California residents, we voluntarily extend its core rights for people to control their data to _all_ of our users, not just those who live in California.

### Other important information

#### Public information on Mooziker

Many of Mooziker services and features are public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing User Website, published by you on the Mooziker website. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing Mooziker information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, may scrape Mooziker and compile data as well.

Your User Personal Information associated with your content could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of Mooziker data. If you do not want your User Personal Information to appear in third parties’ compilations of Mooziker data, please do not make your User Personal Information publicly available by publishing a public facing User Website using Mooziker that contains content you do not wish to be public. For example, your email.

If you would like to compile Mooziker data, you may only use any public-facing User Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a Mooziker user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any User Personal Information you have gathered from Mooziker, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from Mooziker or Mooziker users.


### Additional services

#### Third party applications

You have the option of enabling or adding third-party applications, known as "Developer Products," to your Account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of Mooziker. We will share your User Personal Information with third parties when you ask us to, such as by purchasing a Developer Product from the Marketplace; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Product and for the amount of User Personal Information you choose to share with it. You can check our [API documentation](/v3/users/) to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your Mooziker profile.

#### Mooziker User Websites

If you create a Mooziker User Website, it is your responsibility to post a privacy statement that accurately describes how you collect, use, and share personal information and other visitor information, and how you comply with applicable data privacy laws, rules, and regulations. Please note that Mooziker may collect User Personal Information from visitors to your Mooziker User Website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity of the Website and the Service. For definitions of terms, including "User Website", see [Definitions](/benwigley/mooziker-terms-of-service#a-definitions) in our terms of service.

#### Mooziker applications

You can also add applications from Mooziker, such as our Desktop app, our Atom application, or other application and account features, to your Account. These applications each have their own terms and may collect different kinds of User Personal Information; however, all Mooziker applications are subject to this Privacy Statement, and we collect the amount of User Personal Information necessary, and use it only for the purpose for which you have given it to us.

### How you can access and control the information we collect

If you're already a Mooziker user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user account](https://mooziker.com/account) or contacting Mooziker Support via email at support@mooziker.com. You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your account settings, by keeping your information current, or by contacting [Mooziker Support](mailto:support@mooziker.com).

If Mooziker processes information about you, and you do not have an account, then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, or object to the processing of your personal information by contacting [Mooziker Support](mailto:support@mooziker.com).

#### Data retention and deletion of data

Generally, Mooziker retains User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your [user account](https://mooziker.com/account). We retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days of your request. You may contact Mooziker Support at support@mooziker.com to request the erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days.

### Our use of cookies and tracking

#### Cookies

Mooziker uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Mooziker. For security purposes, we use cookies to identify a device. By using our Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept these cookies, you will not be able to log in or use Mooziker’s services.

We provide a web page on [cookies and tracking](/Policies/mooziker-subprocessors-and-cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the types of cookies they are (temporary or permanent). It also lists our third-party analytics providers and other service providers, and details exactly which parts of our Website we permit them to track.

#### Tracking and analytics

We use a number of third-party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our Users' use of Mooziker, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and Website performance. We only use these third-party analytics providers on certain areas of our Website, and all of them have signed data protection agreements with us that limit the type of User Personal Information they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance.

Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Mooziker responds to browser DNT signals and follows the [W3C standard for responding to DNT signals](https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/). If you have not enabled DNT on a browser that supports it, cookies on some parts of our Website will track your online browsing activity on other online services over time, though we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track Mooziker Users' activity over time on Mooziker.

### How Mooziker secures your information

Mooziker takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.

Mooziker enforces a written security information program. Our program:
- aligns with industry recognized frameworks;
- includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our Users' data;
- is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of Mooziker’s business operations;
- includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and
- complies with applicable information security-related laws and regulations in the geographic regions where Mooziker does business.

In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected Users without undue delay.

Transmission of data on Mooziker is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS (TLS), and git repository content is encrypted at rest. We manage our own cages and racks at top-tier data centers with high level of physical and network security, and when data is stored with a third-party storage provider, it is encrypted.

No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Mooziker's global privacy practices

Wigley Bros Ltd., trading as Mooziker are the controllers responsible for the processing of your personal information in connection with the Service, except (a) with respect to personal information that was added to a website by its contributors, in which case the owner of that website is the controller and Mooziker is the processor (or, if the owner acts as a processor, Mooziker will be the subprocessor); or (b) when you and Mooziker have entered into a separate agreement that covers data privacy (such as a Data Processing Agreement).

Our addresses are:

- Mooziker, Ltd. 278 Glen Lyon Road, Twizel, 7901, New Zealand.

We store and process the information that we collect in New Zealand and the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement, though our service providers may store and process data outside New Zealand and the United States. However, we understand that we have Users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when New Zealand or the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries.

We provide the same high standard of privacy protection—as described in this Privacy Statement—to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location. We work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, working with our Data Protection Officer as part of a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy compliance efforts. Additionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.

In particular:

 - Mooziker provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed, specific, and freely given consent at the time of data collection, when we collect your User Personal Information using consent as a basis.
 - We collect only the minimum amount of User Personal Information necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.
 - We offer you simple methods of accessing, altering, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected, where legally permitted.
 - We provide our Users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access regarding their User Personal Information, and we limit the purpose for processing it. We also provide our Users a method of recourse and enforcement.

#### Cross-border data transfers

Mooziker processes personal information both inside and outside of New Zealand and the United States and relies on Standard Contractual Clauses as the legally provided mechanism to lawfully transfer data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to New Zealand and the United States.

### How we communicate with you

We use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, **and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay**. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we respond to you via email. You have a lot of control over how your email address is used and shared on and through Mooziker. You may manage your communication preferences in your [user account](https://mooziker.com/account).

Depending on your [account settings](https://mooziker.com/account), Mooziker may occasionally send notification emails about changes to the service, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. There's an “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you. Please note that you cannot opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile to opt out of other communications.

Our emails may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email.

### Resolving complaints

If you have concerns about the way Mooziker is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us by email at privacy@mooziker.com with the subject line "Privacy Concerns".

#### Dispute resolution process

In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and Mooziker regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it. Additionally, if you are a resident of an EU member state, you have the right to file a complaint with your local supervisory authority, and you might have more options.

### Changes to our Privacy Statement

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Mooziker may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the primary email address specified in your Mooziker account. We will also update our [Site Policy repository](https://github.com/benwigley/mooziker-site-policy/), which tracks all changes to this policy. For changes to this Privacy Statement that are not material changes or that do not affect your rights, we encourage Users to check our Site Policy repository frequently.
