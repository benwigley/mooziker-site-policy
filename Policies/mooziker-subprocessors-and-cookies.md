Mooziker provides a great deal of transparency regarding how we use your data, how we collect your data, and with whom we share your data. To that end, we provide this page, which details [our subprocessors](#mooziker-subprocessors), how we use [cookies](#cookies-on-mooziker), and where and how we perform any [tracking on Mooziker](#tracking-on-mooziker).

### Mooziker Subprocessors

When we share your information with third party subprocessors, such as our vendors and service providers, we remain responsible for it. We work very hard to maintain your trust when we bring on new vendors, and we require all vendors to enter into data protection agreements with us that restrict their processing of Users' Personal Information (as defined in the [Privacy Statement](/benwigley/mooziker-privacy-statement/)).

| Name of Subprocessor | Description of Processing | Location of Processing | Corporate Location
|---|---|---|---|
| AWS Amazon | Data hosting | United States | United States |
| Bugsnag | Application monitoring provider | United States | United States |
| Doorbell | Customer support ticketing system | United States | United States |
| Google Apps | Internal company infrastructure | United States | United States |
| Google Analytics | Website analytics and performance | United States | United States |
| MailChimp | Email services provider | United States | United States |
| Sendgrid | Transactional mail services provider | United States | United States |
| Soundcloud | Music hosting provider | United States | United States |
| Spotify | Music hosting provider | United States | United States |
| Stripe | Payment provider | United States | United States |

When we bring on a new subprocessor who handles our Users' Personal Information, or remove a subprocessor, or we change how we use a subprocessor, we will update this page. If you have questions or concerns about a new subprocessor, we'd be happy to help. Please contact us via {% data variables.contact.contact_privacy %}.

### Tracking on Mooziker

"[Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track)" (DNT) is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services — specifically ad networks — to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. Mooziker responds to browser DNT signals and follows the [W3C standard for responding to DNT signals](https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/). If you would like to set your browser to signal that you would not like to be tracked, please check your browser's documentation for how to enable that signal. There are also good applications that block online tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger).

If you have not enabled DNT on a browser that supports it, cookies on some parts of our website will track your online browsing activity on other online services over time, though we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track Mooziker users' activity over time on Mooziker. We use these cookies to allow us to advertise Mooziker products and services to you on third party websites and services. We also have agreements with certain vendors, such as analytics providers, who help us track visitors' movements on certain pages on our site. Only our vendors, who are collecting personal information on our behalf, may collect data on our pages, and we have signed data protection agreements with every vendor who collects this data on our behalf. We use the data we receive from these vendors to better understand our visitors' interests, to understand our website's performance, and to improve our content. Any analytics vendor will be listed in our Subprocessor List above, and you may see a list of every page where we collect this kind of data below.

#### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics as a third party analytics service, and to track our advertising campaigns on third party websites and services. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use Mooziker. This helps us evaluate our users' use of Mooziker; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and [offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

#### Pages on Mooziker where analytics may be enabled

Pages at URLs that contain any of the following domains and paths (including any subdomains or subpaths) on our sites may have analytics or other tracking code enabled. If you would like to prevent us from collecting information about your browsing activity on Mooziker, you may use a tracking blocker such as [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) or opt out of Google Analytics tracking.
