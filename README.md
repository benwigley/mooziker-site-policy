We are thankful to [GitHub](https://github.com) for open sourcing the use of it's policies and procedures. At Mooziker we have adapted certain policies from GtiHub's open sourced [site-policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository. If you are in need for a starting point for your own legal documents I reccomend you check them out. They are proud to offer their policies under [CC0-1.0](https://github.com/github/site-policy/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
